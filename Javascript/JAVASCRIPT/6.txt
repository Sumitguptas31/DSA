=> What is Lexical Environment?

A Lexical Environment is a place where variables and functions are stored when a 
function is created or executed.

It has two parts:
Local memory – variables and functions declared in the current function.
Reference to outer environment – variables from the outer function or global scope.


=> Lexical scoping.
Every function remembers where it was written in the code.Because of that,
 it can access variables from its outer scope — this is called lexical scoping.
