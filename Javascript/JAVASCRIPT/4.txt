Promise and async await 
Promise=>
 A Promise in JavaScript is an object. that represents the eventual result of
 an asynchronous operation.
 It’s used when something takes time to finish, like fetching data from an API,
 reading a file, or waiting for a timer—instead of blocking the code,
 JavaScript uses a Promise to handle the result later.

Promise has 3 states:
Pending – the operation is still going.
Fulfilled – the operation completed successfully.
Rejected – the operation failed with an error.

=> async/await:
async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises that allows writing asynchronous code
in a synchronous style,
 making it easier to read and maintain.
