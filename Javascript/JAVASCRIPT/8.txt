 What is Temporal Dead Zone?

 Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is the time between when a variable is declared with 
 let or const and when it is actually initialized,
 during which you cannot access the variable — if you try,
 it will throw a ReferenceError.

 You can't use a let or const variable before it's declared in the code
  — doing so puts it in the TDZ.

  console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
  let a = 10;

  //*******************************************

TDZ only happens with let and const, not with var.
var gets hoisted and initialized as undefined, so it doesn’t cause a ReferenceError.

console.log(x); //  undefined
var x = 5;

console.log(y); //  ReferenceError
let y = 5;
